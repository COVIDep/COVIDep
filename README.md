# COVIDep

COVIDep provides an up-to-date set of B-cell and T-cell epitopes that can serve as potential vaccine targets for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. This virus is also referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), or the 2019 human coronavirus (hCoV-19). The identified epitopes are experimentally-derived from SARS-CoV (the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak) and have a close genetic match with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

We thank all the authors, the originating and submitting laboratories for sharing SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences and SARS-CoV epitopes through the GISAID and VIPR databases, respectively. We also thank the IEDB database for providing the population coverage estimation tool for T cell epitopes.
